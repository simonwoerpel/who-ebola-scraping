how to scrape who ebola data

see notebooks how to do it and `requirements.txt` for required python packages

1. scrape available dates: `getdates.ipynb`
2. use this data to download actual files: `getfiles.ipynb`
3. merge all files into one dataset (and try to cleanup some stuff): `merge_csv.ipynb`
